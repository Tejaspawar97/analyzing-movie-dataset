My aim in this project is to explore the movie dataset and find some movies with high ratings. My friend has just begun with his vacations and wants me to suggest some good movies for him to watch.

Since I have just learned Python, I decided to use my Python skills to analyze a movie dataset and explore the ratings of the movies. In this dataset, we have the details of the movies in more than 50 languages, but my friend is interested only in watching English movies. Thus, My goal is to analyze the data and suggest English movies with high-ratings to My friend
